*I'm not responsible for any consequences that result from using this code. BattleState / BattlEye will ban you if you try to use it 'live'. Use it safely offline with [SPT](https://sp-tarkov.com/).*

***TLDR => Use the [Universal Installer](https://github.com/sailro/EscapeFromTarkov-Trainer/releases).*** Default key for in-game GUI is `Right-Alt`.

`master` branch can build against `EFT 0.16.1.35392` (tested with [`SPT Version 3.11.1`](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/16-spt/#versions)). If you are looking for another version, see [`branches`](https://github.com/sailro/EscapeFromTarkov-Trainer/branches) and [`releases`](https://github.com/sailro/EscapeFromTarkov-Trainer/releases).

> If you want to compile the code yourself, make sure you cleaned-up your solution properly after upgrading your EFT/sptarkov bits (even removing `bin` and `obj` folders) and check all your references.

> If you are using `SPT`, please make sure you have run the game at least once before compiling/installing the trainer. `SPT` is patching binaries during the first run, and we need to compile against those patched binaries.

> The typical issue when something is out of sync is that the game will freeze at the startup screen with type/tokens errors in `%LOCALAPPDATA%Low\Battlestate Games\EscapeFromTarkov\Player.log`
